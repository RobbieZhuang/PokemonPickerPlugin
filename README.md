## Quickstart

-   Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
-   Run `npm run watch` to start webpack in watch mode.
-   Open `Figma` -> `Plugins` -> `Development` -> `Import plugin from manifest...` and choose `manifest.json` file from this repo.

## Toolings

This repo is using:

-   React + Webpack
-   TypeScript
-   Prettier precommit hook
-   S/O to https://github.com/nirsky/figma-plugin-react-template for the React template!
-   Also huge S/O to https://pokemontcg.io/ for the amazing card API! Without that project, this one wouldn't be possible :)
